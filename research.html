<p class=SUBTITLE>The Big Picture</p>
<!--l. 122--><p class=REGTEXT >The most pressing question in fundamental
physics and cosmology is understanding the nature of dark energy. My research
is at the forefront of learning how best to use type Ia supernovae
(SN&#x00A0;Ia) to deduce its mysterious properties. To that end, I have been
involved in nearly every stage of astrophysical research, including planning
and leading large survey programs, reduction and analysis of multi-terabyte
datasets, and developing sophisticated statistical models for unbiased
inference from the data. <br><br>
You can read more about my research below. I've elected to present projects in
chronological order, to give you a sense for the evolution of ideas.

<div class=MAIN>
 <a id="x1-10001"></a><p class=SUBTITLE>SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;Cosmology with ESSENCE</p>
<!--l. 136--><p class=REGTEXT >Since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe in 1998 [<a 
href="#Xperlmutter99">15</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xriess98">17</a>], type Ia supernovae (SN&#x00A0;Ia) have remained
our most sensitive probe of dark energy. Many of the members of the High-Z Supernova Search Team came together
as the ESSENCE (Equation of State: SupErNova tracE Cosmic Expansion) project, which I joined at the
start of my graduate studies in 2005. ESSENCE aimed to observe 200 SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;over seven years, in <span 
class="cmmi-10">R </span>and
<span 
class="cmmi-10">I </span>at a median redshift of 0.4, and constrain the equation of state of dark energy, <span 
class="cmmi-10">w</span>, to 10%. I was heavily
involved in schedule optimization, imaging, spectroscopic follow-up, pipeline development, data reduction and
analysis.</p>

<!--l. 147--><p class=REGTEXT >ESSENCE has provided many valuable insights to
the supernova &amp; cosmology communities, and has helped define the incisive
questions that my current research focuses on answering. An early analysis of
the first four years of survey data [<a href="#Xwv07">24</a>], discovered that
SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;studies were very sensitive to how the effects of dust are
disentangled from intrinsic color variations. Fundamentally,
SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;cosmology rests on a comparison between the luminosity of
nearby and distant supernovae. The difference in redshift necessitates that
this comparison is done between different rest-frame and observer-frame
passbands. The difference in comoving volume implies a vastly different number
density of events on the sky. This, in turn, necessitates completely different
observing strategies for nearby and distant supernovae, and the cosmological
experiment must combine and compare data from different surveys, each with
their own distinct pathologies. Consequently, the covariance matrix between
SN&#x00A0;Ia-derived cosmological parameters and the photometric calibration of
constituent surveys has a complex structure.</p>

<!--l. 163--><p class=REGTEXT >My thesis work completed the final analysis of
ESSENCE photometry and spectroscopy. I made several key improvements to the
pipeline used by ESSENCE and worked on reducing the photometric uncertainties
in the ESSENCE survey. I have developed codes to process photometric data
obtained with the CTIO 4&#x00A0;m telescope, established a network of tertiary
standards tied to the spectrophotometric standard BD+17<span
class="cmsy-7">&#x2218;</span>4708 across the survey fields, and re-calibrated
the natural photometric system to avoid various sources of systematic errors
present in the 4&#x00A0;year data release [<a href="#Xmiknaitis07">9</a>]. My
efforts have reduced the photometric uncertainties to the <span

 <a id="x1-10001"></a><p class=SUBTITLE>Pan-STARRS and Supernova Demographics</p>
<!--l. 178--><p class=REGTEXT >The Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey (MDS) aimed to
reduce the effect of photometric systematics on cosmological inference with a
single homogeneous dataset with both nearby and distant SN&#x00A0;Ia.
Pan-STARRS produced significantly deeper imaging than was possible with SDSS,
and access a considerably larger volume. Much of the challenge of wide-area
surveys comes in developing the logical structures and algorithms to process
the large data volumes produced &#8212; to &#8220;drink from the fire
hose.&#8221; Along with Armin Rest and Mark Huber, I adapted the search
pipeline developed for the ESSENCE to Pan-STARRS. To date, this pipeline has
processed more than 900&#x00A0;TB of data, and discovered more than 450
spectroscopically confirmed SN. I was involved in the reduction, and follow-up
of various candidates, and participated heavily in the first-year release and
analysis of SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;data [<a href="#XRest13">16</a>,&#x00A0;<a
href="#XScolnic13">19</a>].</p>
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
<!--l. 191--><p class=REGTEXT >However, even as Pan-STARRS observed, further
research indicated that SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;required unphysical reddening laws,
with <span class="cmmi-10">R</span><sub><span class="cmmi-7">V</span> </sub>
<span class="cmmi-10">&#x003C; </span>2<span class="cmmi-10">.</span>1 to
minimize the dispersion in Hubble residuals [<a href="#Xhicken09b">4</a>], that
differences in UV colors of SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;could bias <span
class="cmmi-10">w</span> by as much as 30% (Milne), weak but significant trends
of Hubble residual with host-galaxy properties [<a href="#Xkelly10">6</a>],
such as host luminosity &amp; specific star formation rate [<a
href="#Xsullivan10">21</a>], as well as correlations between
&#8220;independent&#8221; parameters derived from SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;light
curves [<a href="#Xhicken09a">5</a>], correlations of the parameters with
redshift indicating cosmological bias [<a href="#Xkessler09a">7</a>], as well
as distinct sub-classes in what was long thought to be a family
single-parameter of events [e.g.&#x00A0;<a href="#XFoley10">1</a>,&#x00A0;<a
href="#Xfoley09">2</a>,&#x00A0;<a href="#XNarayan11">12</a>,&#x00A0;<a
href="#Xwang09">22</a>].</p>


<!--l. 203--><p class=REGTEXT >Some of these can be addressed by observations
outside the optical. SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;are not only better standard candles
in the infrared, but are significantly less affected by host-galaxy extinction
at those wavelengths. Along with Kaisey Mandel, I have also worked on
developing a hierarchical Bayesian model for SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;[<a
href="#XMandel11">8</a>] that we are currently adapting for use in the
observer-frame at high-redshift. These two models, <span
class="cmmi-10">MLCS</span>3 and <span class="cmmi-10">BayeSN</span>, developed
from the most current, high-precision nearby samples, will become the standard
for extracting distance moduli from high-<span class="cmmi-10">z
</span>SN&#x00A0;Ia. However, we must still understand the diversity of
SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;events, and if they do not form a single-parameter family
of events, this approach alone will not suffice.</p>


<a href="Images/NUV_hist_kde_for_rstt.png"><img src="Images/NUV_hist_kde_for_rstt.png" width="700" alt="Modeling Swift UV measurements, and identifying distinct sub-classes of SNIa with kernel density estimations" title="Lets figure out colors!" class=mid></a><br>
<!--l. 214--><p class=REGTEXT >I have been working with Prof. Peter Milne at UA
to study the ultraviolet properties of SN&#x00A0;Ia. Type Ia supernovae have
been considered a single-parameter family, where variation in peak luminosity
can be correlated with decline rate, or other measures of light curve shape.
Milne et&#x00A0;al.&#x00A0;[<a href="#XMilne2013">10</a>] has suggested that
there are two groups of SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;exhibiting different ultraviolet
colors, reflecting differences in ejecta velocity from optical spectroscopy.
Despite the limited number of supernovae with Swift <span
class="cmmi-10">uvw</span>1 measurements, I was able to construct robust color
templates for a subset of these objects. Constructing the mean residuals to the
templates allows to separate the supernovae into two much more distinct groups,
while kernel density estimation is used to robustly and automatically identify
the two groups. I simulated the effect of two groups with different UV color,
and showed that it biases the dark energy equation of state in the same
direction as the biases currently found by SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;cosmological
studies [<a href="#XMilne15">11</a>].</p>


<!--l. 229--><p class=REGTEXT >Accordingly, my research has established the
need for new, more detailed observations that, combined with the vast amount of
contextual information in large datasets, will allow us to significantly deepen
our understanding of the nature of SN&#x00A0;Ia.  This will allow us to truly
disentangle these effects, rather than modeling them with a purely empirical
set of relations with ad-hoc parameterizations.

<a id="x1-20002"></a><p class=SUBTITLE>Establishing High-Precision Spectrophotometric Standards</p>
<!--l. 240--><p class=REGTEXT >The level of photometric precision I achieved
with ESSENCE &amp; Pan-STARRS will be insufficient for current and future
wide-field SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;surveys that aim to look for evidence of
evolution in the dark energy equation of state with redshift. These surveys are
still limited by the lack of calibrated spectrophotometric standards within the
appropriate dynamic range. The best approach to address this shortcoming is to
establish the system response and tie absolute flux calibration to synthetic
laboratory sources. To this end, I have worked on a novel transmissive
flat-field screen for the Pan-STARRS PS1 telescope [<a
href="#XStubbs10">20</a>]. The system uses a tunable laser to measure the PS1
throughput per pixel, relative to a high-precision NIST photodiode. But
laboratory sources cannot capture the effect of atmospheric variations on
broadband photometry. Such studies will require observations of astrophysical
sources with well measured spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These
considerations motivated my involvement with Dr. Abhijit Saha&#8217;s program
to establish a spectrophotometric network of faint DA white dwarfs using a
combination of Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observations.</p>

<!--l. 257--><p class=REGTEXT >With their simple pure hydrogen atmospheres,
DA white dwarfs are the most reliably modeled astrophysical sources that can
serve as spectrophotometric standards. We were awarded 78 orbits (HST GO
programs 12967 and 13711, P.I.: Saha), and I helped develop the Phase II
proposal for both proposals. I developed an automated parallelized pipeline to
obtain, calibrate, and photometer WFC3 images of our standards, and tie them to
the HST primary flux standards. As we sought faint standards, our targets are
necessarily more distant and are subject to non-negligible interstellar
reddening. I applied my experience modeling SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;and the dust in
their environments to this problem, and we have analyzed data taken with the
HST during Cycle 20. I led the analysis effort and published first results,
demonstrating RMS residuals between observations and models of 3 millimag [<a

<!--l. 270--><p class=REGTEXT >Our early analysis indicated a difference
between the fiducial and true WFC3 zeropoints. I worked with Ralph Bohlin,
Susanna Deustua, and others at STSci to identify differences in detector QE and
flat-field normalization as the source of the discrepancy.  We have corrected
the zeropoints, and tested the fixed WFC3 data products. We obtained 60 hours
of follow-up time on the Las Cumbres network of telescopes to study
variability, and I developed the scheduler to optimize our observations over
the 2017A semester<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<a  id="x1-30003"></a><p class=SUBTITLE>Machine Learning to Identify &amp; Characterize Transients for LSST</p>

<!--l. 287--><p class=REGTEXT>The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST),
the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF) and other future
surveys will be spectroscopically limited. I have previously worked on the
development of one of the first photometric classifiers and redshift estimators
for SN&#x00A0;Ia&#x00A0;[<a href="#XWang07">23</a>]. However, the true
challenge is searching petabytes of images to find and classify <span
class="cmti-10">all </span>known variable and transient sources of interest
from sparse photometry and contextual information, and, perhaps more
importantly, to identify the few truly exotic events in the data stream. This
is an impressive scientific and computational challenge, and to tackle it head
on, I have been working on the ANTARES project [<a href="#XSaha14">18</a>].
ANTARES (Arizona-NOAO Transient Alert and Response to Events System) is a NSF
INSPIRE-funded (IIA-1344024) to develop an event broker capable of ingesting
the entire LSST alert stream &amp; auxiliary feeds in real-time, cross-match
events against external catalogs, derive features from light curves,
characterize understood classes of variability and transient behavior, and
identify the most interesting events for prioritized follow-up studies.</p>

the reference against which all new events are compared. It will also play a
key role in creating realistic simulations of events observed with LSST&#8217;s
cadence, to test our algorithms. I direct a large team of graduate students,
and we have constructed a database containing SDSS, NED, 2MASS, Chandra, WISE
and GAIA and other large catalogs for ANTARES, as well as visualizations for
the system. I am assisting in the deployment of a multi-node compute cluster to
host the entire system at NOAO. I will further develop algorithms to associate
ANTARES alerts with these catalogs, and use what we know about these
associations to help characterize these alerts.</p>

<!--l. 321--><p class=REGTEXT >ANTARES is presently the only full featured

sufficiently to demonstrate a realistic end-to-end system, and we will undergo

I've worked with Professor Linda French at Illinois Wesleyan University on the photometry of primitive objects.            
The group has observed several C and D type asteroids. Of particular interest are the Damocloids.                          
The Damocloids are a group of asteroids with highly eccentric and inclined orbits, similar to those of Halley Family Comets. 
Several Damocloids have already exhibited cometary activity and the dissimilarity of their orbits and Jupiter Family Comet orbits lend credence to the hypothesis.
Broadband photometry of Damocloid nucleii can provide valuable surface information and possibly insight on HFC nucleii. We observed comet C/2002 CE<span class=subscript>10</span>(LINEAR) 
near opposition but photometry of the nucleus was not possible as the object had developed coma during this period.<br><br>
The group has also examined several Trojan asteroids. We are interested in the solar phase angle relation for these objects, and if they exhibit the same kind of opposition effect as main belt asteroids.     <br><br>
I am responsible for the image reduction and analysis of the objects, and was part of a one week observing run at the 0.9m at CTIO during October 2003.<br><br>
