I'm the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/news_release/news/2016-38">Lasker Data
Science Fellow</a> at the <a href="http://www.stsci.edu">Space Telescope
Science Institute</a>!  I'm working on a number of different projects,
including machine learning for automated alert classification with LSST on the
ANTARES project, establishing a network of faint fundamental spectrophotometric
standards for future wide-field surveys, and studying exploding stars near and
far.<br><br>I also care deeply about public outreach and education.<br><br>I'm
a former organizer of <a
href="http://astronomyontap.org/locations/tucson-az/">Astronomy on
Tap-Tucson</a>, do podcasts, panels at sci-fi conventions (Robots! Sci-fi space
battles! Gustav Holst's Planets suite and more!), work with local STEM clubs,
and generally work to get people as excited about science as I am.  <br><br>

<p class=SUBTITLE>The Elevator Pitch</p>
<p class=REGTEXT>
Broadly, my research interests are in cosmology, wide-field UVOIR surveys,
supernovae, and data science (particularly machine learning). Here's a short
summary - you can read more on my <a
href="research.html">research page</a>, and my <a
href="cv.html">CV</a>.<br><br> 

I'm working on the <a
href="https://www.noao.edu/ANTARES/">ANTARES</a> event broker for LSST - an
ambitious project involving astrophysicists, statisticians and computer
scientists at <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/projects/tau/antares/">the
University of Arizona CS Dept.</a> and <a href="http://www.noao.edu">NOAO</a>.
We're working on using machine learning, with novel fast algorithms, and
massive relational transaction time databases to characterize LSST's variable
and transient alert stream. <b>If it goes bump in the night, we'll let you know
what it is (with some confidence interval).</b><br><br>

I'm the <b>lead algorithms developer</b>, curate our very large library
of variable and transient light curves, work with probably every large public
astronomical catalog you can name, help maintain our cluster, and generally
translate between the interdisciplinary scientists working on the project. At
some point in 2017, the GitHub for all this awesomeness will be public, but
until then, hold on!<br><br>

I also work with several other folks at NOAO and <a
href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/crds/calspec.html">STSci</a> on
establishing a network of faint high-precision spectrophotometric standards for
LSST. We got 77 orbits with HST, and a lot of ground-based spectroscopy. I
developed the WFC3 pipeline for our data, did a lot of the observing, wrote the
<a href="https://github.com/gnarayan/LCO_scheduler">scheduler</a> for our
robotic queue observing, lead our preliminary analysis, and have now branched
into developing <a href="https://github.com/gnarayan/WDmodel">hierarchical
Bayesian models</a> of DA white dwarf atmospheres, and interstellar reddening
for inference from our dataset.<br><br>

I've worked with light curves of type Ia supernovae to measure the equation of
state of the dark energy with the <a
href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/essence/">ESSENCE</a> project. I've worked on
modeling SNIa light curves using low-redshift measurements from the <a
href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/">CfA Supernova Group</a>, and other
nearby SN search programs. I've been involved in cosmological investigations
with variables and explosive transients with <a
href="http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/">Pan-STARRS</a>, particularly if
they are SNIa that look funny (odd colors, particularly in the ultraviolet, or
rapid declines, quirky spectra...). I've also worked on pipelines for transient
searches, HPC codes, larger than the average simulations, and try to observe as
much as I can.<br><br>
